A realization of Cyr2Url transliteration scheme -- fully reversible 
translitaration of cyrillic, which can be suited for transliteration to URLs.

FEATURES:
- transliterates all characters from Ukrainian, Russian and Belorussian alphabets + space character
- fully reversible (including the lettercase for cyr-lat-cyr)
- fully URL-compatible (latin characters, dot, underscore, tilde)
- based on the transliteration standard developed by the Terminological Comission of the Natural Sciences (TCNS) of the Kyiv National University
- decently readable transliterated form 

Encoding of non-Ukrainian characters:
э = eh, ў = w                  # TCNS standard
ы = yh, ё = joh, ъ = .h

Examples:
  Ukrajina    = Україна        # TCNS standard
  cvtitenj    = цвітень        # TCNS
  горщик      = ghorshhyk      # TCNS
  p.jatj      = п'ять
  z~jorzhenyj = зйоржений
  ob.hjavytj  = объявить       # Russian alphabet
  johzhyk     = ёжик           # Russian 
  ehlektron   = электрон       # Russian & Belorussian 
  pownyh       = поўны         # Belorussian

Implemented translitaration scheme, Ukrainian URL (UURL) or Cyr2Url, was
invented by Andriy V. Makukha. Author's document describing the scheme can be
